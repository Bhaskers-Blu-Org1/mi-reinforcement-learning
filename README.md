Machine Intelligence Core: Reinforcement Learnig
=========================================

Description
-----------

A subproject of Machine Intelligence Core framework.

The library contains solutions and applications related to reinforcement learning

MIC dependencies
------------
   * MIToolchain - core library of MIC.
   * MIAlgorithms - contains basic (core) types and algorithms.
   * MIVisualization - contains OpenGL-based visualization.

External dependencies
------------
Additionally it depends on the following external libraries:
   * Boost - library of free (open source) peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
   * Eigen - a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
   * OpenGL - a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.


Applications
------------
   *  maze_of_digits_simple_app - simple, probability-based solution to maze-of-digits problem.
